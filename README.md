# Customer Churn Prediction Model

This project aims to predict customer churn using supervised machine learning models. 
## Process Overview
1. **Data Observation and Visualization:** 
    - Explored and visualized the dataset to gain insights into the customer churn patterns and relevant features.

2. **Supervised Models Used:**
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
    - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

3. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluated each model's performance by detecting their classification report and confusion matrices.

4. **ROC Curve Analysis:**
    - Created ROC curves for all five models to visualize their performance.

## Model Performance
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Demonstrated the best performance among the models, showcasing ~92%
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Observed as the least effective model due to auc_score ~70%
  
## Conclusion
The project highlights the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting customer churn. The insights gathered can be utilized for proactive measures to retain customers.
